# Budget Planner

## About

A budget planner app built using React.
Bills can be added, then the total costs of all bills analysed on a daily/monthly/yearly basis and what potential savings would be if certain bills were eliminated.

The goal of this app is to familiarise myself with functional components and hooks.
